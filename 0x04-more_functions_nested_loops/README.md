             #More functions,more nested loops

                  (Project Description:)
  -This project is part of alx-sofware engineering course assessment.It is expected to be done in pure C programming language.
   This project is designed in a way that lets student to understand basic concepts in Functions and nested loops.The test is 
    primarily focused on functions and loops.
 - C programming language is known to be the mother of all programming language and helps fully inderstand how computers operate
under different circumstances.
 -A challenge i encountered in this project is that as a beginner, C programming is not quite friendly and grabbing concepts into
hand required time and persistence.

     -This project merely had some files with each having a source code:
     -These files are :
