                      (Project Title)
               0x05. C - Pointers, arrays and strings

		      (Project Description)
-This project is part of alx-software engineering course test which is based on testing the learner's understanding of the c 
pointers,array and strings.These concepts majorly assist one to understand how computer memory is allocated for various programs
and how data information about the memory can be accessed.

                       (Technologies used on the Project)
-This project is fully based on C programming language.C language provides a clear description on how computers works and how memory is
well handled and maintained by the computer.A learner is able to understand easily about the fundamental operations of the computers.This project is easy to foloow and understand even beginners can easily work on it.
